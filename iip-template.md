## Abstract

<!--
  The Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

## Motivation

<!--
  This section is optional.

  The motivation section should include a description of any nontrivial problems the IIP solves. It should not describe how the IIP solves those problems, unless it is not immediately obvious. It should not describe why the IIP should be made into a standard, unless it is not immediately obvious.

## Specification

<!--
  The Specification section should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current IPNN platforms (redvin and others).

  It is recommended to follow RFC 2119 and RFC 8170. Do not remove the key word definitions if RFC 2119 and RFC 8170 are followed.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

## [Additional Section]

<!--
  REPLACE [Additional Section] TITLE WITH THE NAME OF YOUR SECTION.

  This section is optional.

  An additional section may include various subsections. One such subsection is the "Security Considerations" section, addressing potential security implications of the proposed changes.
